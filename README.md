A simple, server-side Fabric mod that adds a hardcore-style death-ban mechanic to your server, built on the powerful BanHammer API.

This mod raises the stakes of survival gameplay. When a player dies, they are automatically banned from the server for a configurable duration, making every action and encounter more meaningful.

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Automatic Death Bans**: Players who die on your server will be automatically and immediately banned.
  * **Dynamic Ban Reasons**: The ban message reflects the actual cause of death, providing specific reasons for events like falling, drowning, burning in lava, or being slain by another player.
  * **Fully Configurable**: A configuration file (`config/HardcoreBanRevived/config.json`) is automatically generated, allowing you to tailor the experience.
      * Enable or disable the death-ban system entirely.
      * Set the exact ban duration in seconds.
  * **Custom Ban Screen**: The mod leverages the BanHammer API to provide an informative ban screen, telling the player why they were banned and how long they have to wait.
  * **Server-Side Only**: No client installation is required. Players can join your server without needing to install the mod themselves.

## üîß Configuration

Upon the first launch, the mod will create a `config.json` file in your server's `config/HardcoreBanRevived/` directory.

```json
{
    "banDurationSeconds": 604800,
    "banMessage": "You got banned for dying",
    "enableHardcoreBans": true
}
```

Simply edit these values and restart your server to apply the changes.

## üì¶ Dependencies

To use this mod, your server must have the following installed:

  * **Fabric Loader**
  * **Fabric API**
  * **Fabric Language Kotlin**
  * **BanHammer**
